This is basically a Messenger Application similar to the Facebook messenger. 

Using RestAPI, JAX-RS and Jersey, I have developed a messenger application following all the design rules of REST web services. I didn't use any databases instead I used a data structure called **HashMap** to simplify things for me.
It was fun, REST is like **live free or die**.I will keep making it better. Thanks!!
